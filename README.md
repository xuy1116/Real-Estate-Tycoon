# Real-Estate-Tycoon


## Data Collection and Preparation:
* Public records for the property 
* Property characteristics 
* Location convenience scores 
* Neighborhood demographics 
* Schools 
2. Model Selection:
<br>  
Several machine learning models can be used for house price prediction:
* Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between features and price.
* Multiple Regression: An extension of linear regression that handles multiple features.
* Polynomial Regression: Captures non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms of the features.
* Decision Tree Regression: Creates a tree-like structure to make predictions based on feature thresholds.
* Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
* Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
* Split Data: Divide your data into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the unseen testing set.
* Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to improve model performance.
* Model Training: Use the training data to fit the chosen model.
3. Evaluation Metrics:
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squared differences between predicted and actual prices.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE, easier to interpret as it's in the same units as the price.
* R-squared: Proportion of variance in the target variable (price) that is explained by the model.
4. Model Deployment and Monitoring:
* Deployment: Integrate the trained model into an application or system to make predictions on new data.
* Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with updated data to maintain accuracy.
